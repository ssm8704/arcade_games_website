#  Arcade Games – Frontend Project

This is a fun little frontend project featuring a collection of classic arcade games built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. No libraries, no frameworks — just good old vanilla code.

##  Games Included

###  Tic Tac Toe
Simple two-player or player-vs-basic-AI version of the classic game. Play on a 3x3 grid and try to get three in a row.

###  Snake
Control the snake using arrow keys and try to eat as much food as possible without running into yourself or the walls. The speed increases as you grow!

###  Pong
A browser version of the original Pong game. Play against a friend or a simple AI paddle. First to 10 wins!

###  2048
Slide the number tiles to combine them and reach the 2048 tile. Built with grid-based logic and smooth animations.
